# DeepLearning-Specialization-Deeplearning.ai
This repository contains projects covered in the Deeplearning Specialization on Coursera by Deeplearning.ai. 

The course notebooks were based on older versions of the libraries used. To ensure compatibility with the current versions of the libraries, I have made necessary modifications to the projects. I have uploaded these modified notebooks along with other Python files in this repository for future reference. Please note that not all topics covered in the course may be available in this repository at the moment. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide updated versions of the projects that can be run locally with the current library versions. If you are looking for specific projects from the course, please check the repository for the modified versions.
